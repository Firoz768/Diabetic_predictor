Project Roadmap: Diabetes Predictor Website
1. Tech Stack
Here’s the technology you’ll use, divided by frontend, backend, and database:

Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For creating the user interface (e.g., forms, dashboards).

Bootstrap: For responsive design and UI components.

Chart.js or Plotly.js: For interactive visualizations (e.g., model accuracy, confusion matrix).

Backend:

Flask: For handling routes, form submissions, and backend logic.

Python Libraries:

pandas: For data preprocessing (handling uploaded CSV files).

scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and predictions.

matplotlib and seaborn: For generating visualizations.

Database:

MongoDB: To store user credentials and patient prediction data.

Flask-Session: For managing user sessions.

2. Core Features
These are the primary functionalities your website will have:

Authentication System:

Signup: Allow users to register with username and password.

Login: Enable secure login with bcrypt hashed passwords.

Logout: Provide a logout option to end user sessions.

Upload Dataset:

Allow users to upload a CSV file containing patient data (e.g., features and labels).

Perform basic validations (e.g., ensure file format is correct).

Train Machine Learning Model:

Use the uploaded dataset to train a machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier).

Calculate performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

Visualizations and Analysis:

Generate charts like:

Model accuracy score.

Confusion matrix visualization.

Display results interactively using charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or embedded matplotlib images).

Prediction Page:

Provide a form where users can input patient data manually to make predictions based on the trained model.

Dashboard:

Show an overview of all user activities (e.g., uploaded datasets, predictions made, model performance metrics).

3. User Flow
Here’s how the website should work for users:

Landing Page:

A welcoming home page with links to Login or Signup.

Authentication:

Users log in or register via the Auth page.

After login, redirect users to the Dashboard.

Model Analysis:

Users visit the Model Analysis page to upload a dataset and train the model:

File Upload Form.

"Train Model" Button.

Display training results, including:

Accuracy score.

Confusion matrix (as a table and chart).

Predictions:

Users navigate to the Prediction Page:

Enter patient data into a form.

Submit to get predictions in real-time.

Logout:

Users click "Logout" to end their session.

4. High-Level Development Phases
Follow these phases to build your website:

Phase 1: Initial Setup

Set up the Flask application structure (app.py, templates/, static/).

Configure MongoDB and Flask-Session for authentication.

Phase 2: Authentication

Build and test user signup/login/logout functionality.

Store credentials securely in MongoDB.

Phase 3: Model Training

Create a Model Analysis page.

Implement dataset upload and training logic.

Display model metrics after training.

Phase 4: Predictions

Build a Prediction Page.

Implement form-based predictions using the trained model.

Phase 5: Visualizations

Add interactive visualizations for model accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

Phase 6: Final Touches

Add styling and responsiveness using Bootstrap.

Test edge cases (e.g., invalid file uploads, user input errors).

Deploy the website (e.g., on Heroku or AWS).
